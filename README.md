A modern, responsive web dashboard built with **Vue 3 + Vuetify**. This app connects to a secure backend API and visualizes sensor data.

Web App available at: https://salmon-field-08f48e900.6.azurestaticapps.net
* Always use to the above link to avoid (Status 404 Not Found) error

API requests to API serer use secured https.
Auto handle session limit via JWT tokens: 1 day maximum per session.


Please note that this web app is still under development and UX quality is relative low. Sensor data update is only available if my ESP32 is powered on. Thank you for your understanding!
